# Tissue Probability Based Registration for Diffusion Weighted MRI

# Introduction
Multimodal approach for MRI registration using calculated tissue probability maps (TPM) of the brain.
This repository incorporates the source code and (in the future) usable pipeline of this method.

keywords: Diffusion MRI, Tissue Segmentation, Multimodal, Registration

## Recent Updates

 - Uploaded first version of source files of our pipeline. Will add the actual pipeline after coding a usable UI.


# Instructions

## Setup
This implementation is based on several existing python packages:
- [`DIPY`](https://dipy.org/)
- [`NiBabel`](https://nipy.org/nibabel/)
- [`NumPy`](https://numpy.org/)
- [`XGBoost`](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/)
Installing these packages are a prerequisite for using this pipeline.

## TPM Prediction and Registration
Will be added soon!
